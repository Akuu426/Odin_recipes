this project is the first official project assignment on the TOP course that i did without having to code along with the instructor.
it also helped me come to terms with the mastery of the git work flow and the importance of frequent commit of changes to code when one is working.
this project really helped in my understanding of the html structure and process before going into css.
also got a perfect understanding of the need and importance of pushing a project from the local machine to the github into the repository created for the project
